      diagnose: Automatically diagnose the cluster problem and record the problem in below table.
      total_time_consume: The table contain the event time consume in TiDB/TiKV/PD. METRIC_NAME is the event name; LABEL is the event label, such as instance, event type ...; TIME_RATIO is the TOTAL_TIME of this event devide by the TOTAL_TIME of upper event which TIME_RATIO is 1; TOTAL_TIME is the total time cost of this event; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this event; P999 is the max time of 0.999 quantile; P99 is the max time of 0.99 quantile; P90 is the max time of 0.90 quantile; P80 is the max time of 0.80 quantile;
      total_error: The table contain the total count of error event. METRIC_NAME is the error event name; LABEL is the event label, such as instance, event type ...; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this event;
      tidb_time_consume: The table contain the event time consume in TiDB. METRIC_NAME is the event name; LABEL is the event label, such as instance, event type ...; TIME_RATIO is the TOTAL_TIME of this event devide by the TOTAL_TIME of upper event which TIME_RATIO is 1; TOTAL_TIME is the total time cost of this event; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this event; P999 is the max time of 0.999 quantile; P99 is the max time of 0.99 quantile; P90 is the max time of 0.90 quantile; P80 is the max time of 0.80 quantile;
      transaction: The table contain the TiDB transaction statistics information. METRIC_NAME is the object name; LABEL is the object label, such as instance, event type ...; TOTAL_VALUE is the total size/value of this object; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this object; P999 is the max size/value of 0.999 quantile; P99 is the max size/value of 0.99 quantile; P90 is the max size/value of 0.90 quantile; P80 is the max size/value of 0.80 quantile;
      tidb_connection_count: The connection count of tidb server.
      ddl_owner: DDL Owner info. Attention, if no DDL request has been executed, below owner info maybe null, it doesn't indicate no DDL owner exists.
      scheduler_initial_config: PD scheduler initial config value. The initial time is the report start time.
      scheduler_change_config: PD scheduler config change history. APPROXIMATE_CHANGE_TIME is the minimum start effective time.

      tidb_gc_change_config: TiDB GC config change history, APPROXIMATE_CHANGE_TIME is the minimum start effective time.
      tikv_rocksdb_initial_config: TiKV RocksDB initial config value. The initial time is the report start time.
      tikv_rocksdb_change_config: TiKV RocksDB config change history, APPROXIMATE_CHANGE_TIME is the minimum start effective time.
      tikv_raftstore_initial_config: TiKV RaftStore initial config value. The initial time is the report start time.
      tikv_raftstore_change_config: TiKV RaftStore config change history, APPROXIMATE_CHANGE_TIME is the minimum start effective time.
      pd_time_consume: The table contain the event time consume in PD. METRIC_NAME is the event name; LABEL is the event label, such as instance, event type ...; TIME_RATIO is the TOTAL_TIME of this event devide by the TOTAL_TIME of upper event which TIME_RATIO is 1; TOTAL_TIME is the total time cost of this event; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this event; P999 is the max time of 0.999 quantile; P99 is the max time of 0.99 quantile; P90 is the max time of 0.90 quantile; P80 is the max time of 0.80 quantile;
      tikv_time_consume: The table contain the event time consume in TiKV. METRIC_NAME is the event name; LABEL is the event label, such as instance, event type ...; TIME_RATIO is the TOTAL_TIME of this event devide by the TOTAL_TIME of upper event which TIME_RATIO is 1; TOTAL_TIME is the total time cost of this event; TOTAL_COUNT is the total count of this event; P999 is the max time of 0.999 quantile; P99 is the max time of 0.99 quantile; P90 is the max time of 0.90 quantile; P80 is the max time of 0.80 quantile;
